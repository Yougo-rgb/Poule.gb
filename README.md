## 🚀 Installation (Windows)

### 1. Install GBDK  
Download the latest version of **GBDK-2020** here:  
👉 https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020  

> **Note:** This project currently uses **GBDK 4.4.0**.  
> https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020/releases/tag/4.4.0

### 2. Place the GBDK folder  
Move the extracted **gbdk** folder to: `C:\`


Doing so allows you to compile the project without modifying `make.bat`.

### 3. Compile the project  
Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
.\make.bat
```

If everything worked correctly, the compiled ROM will appear in the `/build` folder.

### 4. Play

Open the generated `poule.gb` file with any Game Boy emulator.

## About the project
